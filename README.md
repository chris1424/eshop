🛒 E-Shop Application
This program implements an e-shop system with separate interfaces for admins and customers. It provides full functionality for managing and interacting with products and users.

👤 Customer Features

Customers can:

 * Maintain their own shopping cart:

Add products

Edit or remove previously added items

Complete orders

Search for products and add them directly to their cart

View past orders, which are stored in a file named after their username

Order history is saved immediately upon checkout

🛠️ Admin Features
Admins have extended control and can:

Add new products

Edit existing products

Remove products

View:

The top 5 most ordered products

A list of currently unavailable products

🧱 Internal Structure
The program uses three vectors for data handling:

A vector for users

A vector for products

A vector for the shopping cart

🔄 Data Flow
Product and user data are initially loaded from provided files

All actions during runtime are performed on the in-memory vectors

Files are only updated at the end of the program, except when a customer completes an order (in which case their order file is updated immediately)
